title: Should You Stage Your Home Before Listing It?
teaser-text: I got a question sent to me recently that asked, “Is it worth it to stage my home before putting it on the market?” In my experience, staging your home before putting it on the market is absolutely worth it. If your house already has furniture in it, there are little things we can add to make it that much better. People generally don’t have the vision to look at an empty shell and imagine where they’re going to put their couches, beds, cabinets, etc. To find out more on why you should stage your home before putting it on the market, watch this short video.
