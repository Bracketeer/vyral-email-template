title: What to Know About the Upcoming Market Shift
teaser-text:  If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the near future, you should be prepared for the real estate market shift we’re expecting to see in Raleigh. What do I mean by “shift?” Though we’re not expecting any major changes, we will most likely see our market begin to favor home buyers over sellers. If you’re a seller, this may mean that you can expect your home to sit on the market for a little bit longer, and if you’re a buyer, the shift may mean more options to choose from. To find out what else you should expect from the Raleigh market shift, watch this short video.
Teaser: We’re expecting to experience a shift in the Raleigh market very soon. Here is what that could mean to you as a home buyer or seller.
