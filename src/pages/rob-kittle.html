title: Talking Real Estate With Jimmy Lakey
teaser-text: As you may have heard, I recently sat down for an on-air interview with Jimmy Lakey of Fox News Radio to talk real estate. What did we talk about? Though this is a time of year that the market tends to slow down, right now is a great time to be a buyer. Not only is there less competition out there, but a lot more sellers are currently willing to take contingency offers. To learn more about what Rob and I discussed, watch this short video.
Teaser: Now is a great time to buy in our real estate market. Not only is the market less competitive, but more sellers are willing to take contingencies.
