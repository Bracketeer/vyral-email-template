title: How to Buy and Sell a Home Simultaneously
teaser-text: If you’re thinking about selling your home before buying a new one, you may be afraid of ending up with nowhere to live. Here’s how we can help you.
Teaser: One fear that many home sellers have before accepting offers on their home is that after the buyer signs the contract, they won’t be able to find a place to live. Is it possible to buy a new home while selling your current one? Though this is not an overly common situation in our area, it does happen. In the event that you’re unable to find a home after going under contract on your current one, a good real estate agent will be able to find you a home you love or negotiate to get you more time. To find out how we help our clients do this, watch this short video.
